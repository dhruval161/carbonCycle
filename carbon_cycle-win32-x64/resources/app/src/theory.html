				<h2><i>Terrestrial Carbon Cycle</i></h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>The major processes involved are photosynthesis, respiration and combustion.
				</p><h3>Photosynthesis</h3>
				<p>On land, photosynthesis occurs in trees and other plants. The reaction that primarily takes place is </p>
					<center>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + solar energy → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> +6O<sub>2</sub></center>

				<p>The rate of photosynthesis is dependent on several factors such as light irradiance, temperature, concentration of CO2 in atmosphere. The total average flux from atmosphere to plants is about 123 Gigatons of Carbon/year.
					The plant biomass stores carbon in it till it dies and is decomposed to release the CO<sub>2</sub> back to atmosphere. Though the time duration varies from few years to several hundreds or thousand years, the plant biomass stores about 550 Gigatons of Carbon/year.</p>

  				<h3>Plant Respiration</h3>
  				<p>The plant respiration rate is roughly equal to half of the photosynthesis rate and thus it is assumed to be about 60 Gigatons of Carbon/year.</p>
          <h3>Combustion/ Metabolism</h3>
  				<p>Combustion occurs when any organic material is reacted (burned) in the presence of oxygen to give off the products of carbon dioxide and water and Energy.
            The organic material can be any fossil fuel such as natural gas (methane), oil, or coal. Other organic materials that combust are wood, paper, plastics, and
             cloth. Organic materials contain at least carbon and hydrogen and may include oxygen.</p>
          <p>Metabolism occurs in animals and humans after the ingestion of organic plant or animal foods. In the cells a series of complex reactions occurs with oxygen to convert for example glucose sugar into the products of carbon dioxide and water and Energy.</p>
          <div align="center">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (organic matter) + 6O<sub>2</sub> &rArr; 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy</div>
				<h3>Soil Respiration</h3>
				<p>The soil respiration is the process of respiration of organisms in the soil and it releases CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere at an approximate rate of 60 Gigatons of Carbon/year.
	The soil respiration is exponentially related to temperature. The simple model relation can be expressed as </p>
					<center>R=A*exp(B*T) where A and B are constants.</center>

	<p>The soil acts as a reservoir of carbon and stores about 2300 gigatons of carbon.</p>

	When some of the organic matter undergoes anaerobic decomposition in deep land, fossil fuels are formed and it acts as reservoir  of carbon.
About 10,000 gigatons of carbon is stored in this reservoir for hundreds of millions of years.<p></p>

			<section id="Oceanic Carbon Cycle">
			<h2><i>Oceanic Carbon Cycle</i></h2>
			<h3>Ocean Absorption of CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
			<p>
			Sea water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, creating carbonic acid in the water.
			Scientists estimate that roughly a third of the anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere is (currently) absorbed by Earth's oceans.
			Thus, only about 2/3rds of emissions actually go towards increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2.
			Over time, as more carbon is sequestered into the oceans and the oceans therefore become more acidic (as a result of the carbonic acid produced), scientists expect that the oceans will be able to absorb less and less CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere.
			Thus, in the future, we expect a higher percentage (than the current 67%) of emitted CO2 to remain in the atmosphere... thus promoting greenhouse warming.
			</p>
			<h3>Ocean</h3>
			<p>
			About 30 percent of the carbon dioxide that people have put into the atmosphere has diffused into the ocean through the direct chemical exchange.
			Dissolving carbon dioxide in the ocean creates carbonic acid, which increases the acidity of the water.
			Or rather, a slightly alkaline ocean becomes a little less alkaline. Since 1750, the pH of the ocean’s surface has dropped by 0.1,
			a 30 percent change in acidity.</p>

			<p>The marine carbonate buffer system allows the ocean to take up CO2&nbsp;far in excess of its potential uptake capacity based on solubility alone,
			and in doing so controls the pH of the ocean. This control is achieved by a series of reactions that transform carbon added as CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;into
			HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>&nbsp;and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>. These three dissolved forms are found in the approximate ratio CO<sub>2</sub>:HCO<sup>3–</sup>:CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;
			of 1:100:10</p>
&nbsp;			<p>CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;is a weak acid and when it dissolves, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>)
			and a HCO<sup>3–</sup>&nbsp;ion, with some of the H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;then reacting with CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;to form a second HCO<sup>3–</sup>&nbsp;ion

			</p><center>CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;+ HCO<sup>3–</sup>&nbsp;→ 2H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;+ CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;  (1)</center>

			<center>CO<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;→  HCO<sup>3–</sup>&nbsp;+ H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;+ CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;→ 2HCO<sup>3–</sup>   (2) </center>

			<p>Therefore, the net result of adding CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to seawater is an increase in H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;and HCO<sup>3–</sup>, but a reduction in CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>.
			The decrease in the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2–</sup>&nbsp;ion reduces the overall buffering capacity as CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;increases, with the result that proportionally more H<sup>+</sup>
			&nbsp;ions remain in solution and increase acidity.</p>


			<p>This ocean acidification is leading to a decrease in the saturation state of CaCO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in the ocean.
			Ocean acidification affects marine organisms in two ways. </p>
			<p>First, carbonic acid reacts with carbonate ions in the water to form bicarbonate. However, those same carbonate ions are what shell-building animals like coral
			need to create calcium carbonate shells. With less carbonate available, the animals need to expend more energy to build their shells. As a result, the shells end up
			being thinner and more fragile.</p>
			<p>Second, the more acidic water is, the better it dissolves calcium carbonate. In the long run, this reaction will allow the ocean to soak up excess carbon dioxide because more
			acidic water will dissolve more rock, release more carbonate ions, and increase the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. In the meantime, though, more acidic water will
			dissolve the carbonate shells of marine organisms, making them pitted and weak.</p>


			<h3>Advection -- Surface Currents</h3>
			<p>The wind-driven circulation of the surface waters of the ocean means that there is a mixing or exchange of water between the warm and cold regions of the ocean surface.
			This process is here referred to as advection. It turns out that in terms of net carbon transport, the flow from the warm part of the ocean to the colder part is greater than
			the return, so we will model this process as a unidirectional flow from warm to cold. This addition to cold water is balanced by downwelling.</p>

			<p>The actual amount of carbon transported through advection is not very well constrained, but here we assign it a value of 10 GtC/yr, which is in the range of some other estimates.
			This flow will likely vary according to changes in the circulation pattern of the world's oceans, and also as a function of the concentration of dissolved carbon in the seawater.
			In the form of an equation:</p>

			<center>F<sub>adv</sub> = WarmSurfOc * ( 10 / INIT(WarmSurfOc)</center>

			<p>where F<sub>adv</sub>&nbsp;is the flow of carbon by advection and WarmSurfOc is the reservoir of carbon stored in the warm surface waters of the world's oceans</p>

			<p>In addition to changes in advection and mixing, the ocean can alter atmospheric CO2&nbsp;concentration through three mechanisms</p>
			<ol>
			<li> absorption or release of CO2&nbsp;due to changes in solubility of gaseous CO2&nbsp;(‘solubility pump’)</li>
			<li> changes in carbon fixation to POC in surface waters by photosynthesis and export of this carbon through sinking of organic particles out of the surface layer (‘organic carbon pump’) –
			this process is limited to first order by availability of light and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, silicic acid and micronutrients such as iron) </li>
			<li> changes in the release of CO2&nbsp;in surface waters during formation of CaCO3&nbsp;shell material by plankton (‘CaCO3&nbsp;counter pump’)</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Downwelling</h3>

			<p>Downwelling transfers cold surface waters into the deep interior of the oceans, and as a result, carbon is transferred as well. The magnitude of the flow is thus a
			function of the volume of water flowing and the average concentration of carbon in the cold surface waters, which is itself a function of the total amount of carbon stored
			in this reservoir, assuming that the size of the reservoir is not changing appreciably over the few hundred years that this model is intended to be used for.</p>

			<p>The flow of carbon from the cold, shallow water to deep water will simply be a function of how much carbon is stored in the cold surface water reservoir assuming the flow is unaltered. </p>

			<center>F<sub>dw</sub>=CSurfOc*(96.2)/INIT(CSUrfOC)</center>

			<p>where F<sub>dw</sub>&nbsp;is the flow of carbon due to downwelling, in GtC/yr. This equation is set so that at the beginning, the magnitude of this flow will be 96.2,
			which is within the range of current estimates, adjusted here to make the system be in a steady state.</p>

			<h3>Upwelling</h3>

			<p>Upwelling is the converse of downwelling, and as the deep waters rise to the surface, they bring with them carbon. Upwelling occurs in areas of the oceans where
			winds and surface currents diverge, moving the surface waters away from a region; in response, deep waters rise up to fill the "void".</p>

			<center>F<sub>up</sub>=DeepOc*(105.6)/INIT(DeepOc)</center>

			<h3>Sedimentation</h3>

			<p>Some of the carbon, both organic and inorganic (i.e., calcium carbonate shells) produced by marine biota and transferred to the deep oceans settles out onto the
			seafloor and accumulates there, eventually forming sedimentary rocks. The magnitude of this flow is small -- about 0.6 Gt C/yr -- relative to the total amount transferred by sinking
			from the surface waters -- 10 Gt C/yr. The reason for this difference is primarily because the deep waters of the oceans dissolve calcium carbonate shell materials; below about 4 km,
			the water is so corrosive that virtually no calcium carbonate material can accumulate on the seafloor. In addition, some of the organic carbon is consumed by organisms living in
			the deep waters and within the sedimentary material lining the sea floor. This consumption results in the release of CO2&nbsp;into the bottom waters and thus decreases the amount of
			carbon that is removed from the ocean through this process.  The equation for this flow is:</p>

			<center>F<sub>sed</sub> = ( F<sub>swob</sub> + F<sub>scot</sub>)*0.6/10 </center>

			<p>where F<sub>sed</sub>&nbsp;is the transfer of carbon from the deep ocean reservoir to the sedimentary rock reservoir,
			and F<sub>swob</sub>&nbsp;and F<sub>scot</sub>&nbsp;are the flows of carbon from the warm and cold surface ocean biota. This equation is set up so that initially, with F<sub>swob</sub>
&nbsp;			and F<sub>scot</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;set to total 10 Gt C/yr, the F<sub>sed</sub>&nbsp;flow will have a value of 0.6 Gtc/yr.</p>
